# Generaidor

A Static Site Generator, currently built with PHP. The name is a bit of wordplay, but it accidentally matches with the YugiOh card.


## Motivation & Spirit
Every project is built with some sort of motivation behind it, as it exists for a reason. For example, Go exists because Go's founders were frustrated with the languages they were using at Google. And Generaidor is no different. This project was built because I want to learn and I want to complete something on my own.

## Folder Structure
Below is the explanation of what role each folder plays in this project. It will be updated.
